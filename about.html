					<h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my web dev crash course project.</h1>
					<p>This site is available thanks to Udemy, and specially Jordan Hudgens, on Youtube, with their video on HTML5, CSS and JS development. So be sure to check them out if you want to do something like this (I'll leave a link below to the specific video), since they are the ones spreading all this knowledge for free.</p>
					<p>Now for some information about me... Hi, I am Michele Massa, also known as Arael_00, and I am a student working towards his CS specialist at the University of Toronto who is really into side projects and as you could have guessed by the theme of this website, Overwatch and Overwatch League in general LOL. I took this crash course on web development to help me with the making of a website for an independent project I am currently working on called R4F, which is a birthday notification/manager app, since I always seem to forget all the special dates... yikes.</p>
					<p>If you have any questions about this site and want to get into contant with me, please either shoot me an email at: massamichele802@gmail.com, or add me on discord at: michelemassa_802#2066.</p>
					<p>The link is the following:</p>
